The **Variance**

In a population, **variance** is the average squared deviation from the population mean, as defined by the following formula:

σ2 = Σ ( Xi - μ )2 / N

where σ2 is the population variance, μ is the population mean, Xi is the ith element from the population, and N is the number of elements in the population.

Observations from a simple random sample can be used to estimate the variance of a population. For this purpose, sample variance is defined by slightly different formula, and uses a slightly different notation:

s2 = Σ ( xi - x )2 / ( n - 1 )

where s2 is the sample variance, x is the sample mean, xi is the ith element from the sample, and n is the number of elements in the sample. Using this formula, the sample variance can be considered an unbiased estimate of the true population variance. Therefore, if you need to estimate an unknown population variance, based on data from a simple random sample, this is the formula to use.

The Standard Deviation
The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. Thus, the standard deviation of a population is:

σ = sqrt [ σ2 ] = sqrt [ Σ ( Xi - μ )2 / N ]

where σ is the population standard deviation, μ is the population mean, Xi is the ith element from the population, and N is the number of elements in the population.

Statisticians often use simple random samples to estimate the standard deviation of a population, based on sample data. Given a simple random sample, the best estimate of the standard deviation of a population is:

s = sqrt [ s2 ] = sqrt [ Σ ( xi - x )2 / ( n - 1 ) ]

where s is the sample standard deviation, x is the sample mean, xi is the ith element from the sample, and n is the number of elements in the sample.
